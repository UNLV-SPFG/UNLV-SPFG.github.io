Avery Bailey was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas,
working with [Prof. Zhaohuan Zhu](/team/zhu-zhaohuan/).
Avery's research focuses on the formation and evolution of planets with applications to our own solar system as well as the ever-increasing sample of confirmed exoplanets.
Within this field, he tackles problems related to circumplanetary disk dynamics, planet-disk interaction, hydrodynamic instabilities, and envelope formation.
To model these complex physical systems, he employs numerical methods and multi-dimensional simulations accounting for both hydrodynamics and radiative transfer.
As a result, he is an expert in numerical methods and high performance computing as applied to astrophysical contexts.
