Yihan Wang is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Nevada Center for Astrophysics (<a href='https://ncfa.physics.unlv.edu/' target='_blank'>NCfA</a>).
His research interests include tidal disruption events by solar mass black holes, gamma-ray bursts in dense environments, few-body scattering with applications ranging from supermassive black hole dynamics in galactic centers to the production of hypervelocity stars, to binary compact object mergers in AGN disks, to exoplanetary architectures and hot Jupiter formation in dense star clusters.
He is also an astrophysical software developer who is devoted to contributing high-performance tools to the community.
