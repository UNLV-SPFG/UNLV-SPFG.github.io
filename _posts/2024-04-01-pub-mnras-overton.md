## Selected Figures 

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/news/Overton2025_fig3.jpeg" caption="**Figure 3.** The column density of the prograde Be star disc (upper row) and retrograde Be star disc (middle row) at times $$t = 45$$ (left), $$55$$ (middle), and $$65 P_{\rm orb}$$ (right) in the $$x-y$$ plane in which both the Be star and the neutron star orbit. The bottom row shows the dimensionless quantity $$\Psi$$ at the same times for the retrograde disc. Only the values of $$\Psi$$ are shown where the surface density is greater than $$10^{-2}$$g cm$$^2$$" %}
