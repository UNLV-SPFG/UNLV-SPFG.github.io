## Introduction

Finding planets around other stars is extremely difficult because the planets are faint compared to the star that they orbit. However, we have been very sucessful at finding planets through indirect methods that observe the effect of the planet on its star. The two most sucessful methods are the transit method and the radial velocity method. In the transit method, we observation a periodic dimming of the star as the planet passes in front of it. The radial velocity method measures the motion of the star as the planet orbits around it.  We have found about 5000 thousand exoplanets so far including many in multiplanet systems. 

## Exoplanets

The planets in the solar system have well ordered orbits. They are all close to circular and their orbital planes are close to coplanar to each other and close to aligned to the spin of our Sun.  The small and rocky terrestrial planets are close to the Sun, while the gaseous giant planets are farther away. However, many of the exoplanetary systems observed are quite different to the solar system. The first planets to be found were "hot Jupiters". These are planets with a mass similar to Jupiter that are even closer to their star than Mercury is to our Sun. Our standard planet formation theories were unable to explain how these planets could form so close to their star. We think that they formed farther out and later migrated inwards. Planet migration can occur within the protoplanetary disk or through later gravitational interactions with other planets and bodies.  Exoplanets are also observed in orbits that can be highly eccentric or highly misaligned, meaning that the orbital plane of the planet is misaligned to the spin of the star. Planets that form in a gas disc are expected to be in circular and coplanar orbits. These planets must have undergone some later gravitational interactions to be found in these orbits. 


## Resonances

Resonances can occur when there are multiple bodies orbiting around a star and they exert a periodic gravitational tug on each other. In most cases, this leads to an unstable interaction. The bodies exchange angular momentum until the resonance no longer exists. However, in some cases, it can lead to a stable resonant orbit. Mean motion resonances occur when the orbital period of two objects are related by a ratio of integers.

The $\nu_6$ resonance is a secular resonance that occurs at the inner edge of our current asteroid belt. The resonance occurs if the apsidal precession frequency of an asteroid is equal to the eigenfrequency of Saturn. Asteroids that are in the location of this resonance have their eccentricity increased and this leads to collisions with other planets or ejection. This resonance has long been thought to be an important source of asteroids that collided with the Earth. Asteroid collisions may be necessary for the delivery of water (Martin & Livio 2021), the formation of our Moon, the delivery of heavy elements to the surface of the Earth, and perhaps for the delivery of the building blocks of life itself. 

## Post-Main Sequence

When our Sun dies, it will undergo significant mass loss on the red-giant branch and the asymptotic giant branch phases. The outer envelop expands during these phases and may engulf planets that are close in. The Earth is thought to be close to the survival limit. As a result of the mass loss, any surviving bodies expand outwards. The asteroid belt and the giants planets should survive this process. 

The Sun will eventually become a white dwarf.  White dwarfs are made up of electron-degenerate material. They have a mass similar to the Sun, but a volume similar to the Earth! A white dwarf is no longer undergoing fusion and so the luminosity comes from its residual thermal energy. 



### White Dwarf Pollution

A large fraction of white dwarfs are observed to have metal-polluted atmospheres. Metals in the white dwarf atmosphere should sink rapidly into the interior. Since we observe pollution for up to 600Myr after the white dwarf forms, there must be continuous accretion of metal-rich material on to these white dwarfs.  The currently favoured mechanism for feeding the poliution is planetary material that gets tidally disrupted through close encounters with the white dwarf. This material forms a debris disc around the white dwarf before it gets accreted.  In order to feed the white dwarf with asteroids, there must be some instabliity in the remaining debris. Smallwood et al. (2018, 2021) showed that the $\nu_6$ resonance may be able to provide a sufficiently large supply of asteroids once our Sun becomes a white dwarf and that this mechansim could operate more generally in other systems.
