## Introduction

Most stars are in binary star systems rather than being single stars like our Sun. Protoplanetary disks can form around each separate component of a wide binary, but also around both components of a close binary. These are known as circumbinary disks and they may also be a site for planet formation. Indeed, around 20 circumbinary planets have been found so far. Circumbinary planets are much more difficult to detect than planets that orbit around a single star. Inner and outer binary components can have a significant impact on the dynamics and evolution of a protoplanetary disk and the planets that may form in the disk. In order to explain the observed properties of exoplanets, we need to understand the impact of binary companions.

## Circumbinary planet dynamics

While all of the currently observed circumbinary planets are in orbits that are close to coplanar to the binary orbit, this may be a result of selection effects. Many circumbinary gas discs are observed to be misaligned to the orbital plane of the binary and so planet formation may be able to proceed in a misaligned disc.  

There are two inclinations for stationary orbits around an eccentric binary (meaning orbits that do not undergo nodal precession): first, when the planet orbit is coplanar to the binary orbit and second, when the planet orbit is polar to the binary orbit. In a polar orbit, the angular momentum of the planet is aligned to the eccentricity vector of the binary.  At any other inclination, the planet orbit undergoes nodal precession about the binary angular momentum vector for low initial inclination, or about the binary eccentricity vector for high inclination (Chen et al. 2019).  

There is an innermost stable orbital radius where planets can stably orbit around a binary.  Around a very eccentric binary, polar planets are actually at the most stable inclination (Chen et al. 2020). A two-planet system around a binary is subject to complex tilt oscillations as a result of planet-planet and planet-binary interactions (Chen et al. 2022).
